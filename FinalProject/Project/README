					                                    Project plan

My plans to completing the project :
    1.Writing code diary each week 
	How I will deal with any problems that could arise:
	Whenever any problem arises I will first make sure I note down what the problems are in my diary.
	I will check chrome debug tools to spot any obvious syntax errors and to locate the line or file 
	that was causing issues and try to solve it before seeking support from a classroom mate over social
	media or team then if the problem still can't be resolved I will contact by email teacher or attend 
	CM for supports. To solve me I use google to examples and similar issues that other people have faced 
	example on StackOverflow and p5 official website.

    2.Initial plan: add listed features to the Drawing app
        •	Editable Shape (1 week)
                o	Able to create shapes and edit it
        •	Square & ellipse eraser tool (1 week)
                o	With an outline to show the area of the eraser is erasing
                o	Adjustable size
                o	Pop up window to inform user how to use it
        •	Star trail (1week)
                o	Size configures	
        •	Uploading image (1week)
                o	Drag and drop or Button to upload
                o	Limit to only images formats
        •   finishing up and testing (1 week)

Week 1 :
Features have implemented so far:
    *eraserTool: started but very buggy and dose not work at all
    *editShape : started but very buggy and dose not work at all

End of week evaluation: 
During week 1, I had a try to code the eraserTool and editShape function right into the file and I failed miserably without
any researches because I felt it should be easy, later on I know I was quit wrong because I coding on top of others code in this case 
the example template is difficult without a clear understanding of the code structure. The end result is that none of the function I 
Have implemented is buggy and dose not work at all.

Plan for next week:
my plan for next week is start over and make sure I get a better view of the structure then restart my coding. If I get stuck and
I can't solve it myself I will ask other people to seek help or ask in the VCH.

Week 2 :
Features have implemented so far:
    * eraserTool 
        completed:
            1. functional ellipse eraser
                //its working but its still buggy and could be improved where ellipse outliner is also drawing to the canvas 
        incomplete:
            1. Add a rectangle eraser
            2. make eraser size Adjustable
                //after research and experience with Photoshop I am thinking adding a slider to adjust the size
                //However I am having problem with adding a slider to the toolbox section
                //I am gonna use the VCH to seek helps and supports in next week

            3. fix bug of setting the fill and stroke colour back 
                to what was selected(at the moment I manually 
                set it back to black)
                
            4. Adding pop up window when the tool is first selected for
                better user experience. e.g. how to switch between ellipse and 
                squared eraser and how to adjust the eraser size

    * editShape 
        completed:
            1. functional editShape

        incomplete:
            1. Adding pop up window when the tool is first selected for better user experience. 
    
    Function that I have implemented to the sketch file
        1. Check for weather the mouse is in the canvas 
        2. check and load toolSelected function to load any tool that's been selected with its default configure settings



End of week evaluation: 
During week 2, I manage to have a basic working eraser tool and editshape tool working but is still incomplete. I was having problem 
To find a way to add tool specific menus to the canvas because I was having problem to add multiple buttons. The edishape is functional but I 
wasn't able to find a way to finish the shape.


Plan for next week: I am going to attend the VCH again to seek help and continue with my coding and make sure I follow my schedule to start coding a new function
Startracks.

Week 3 :
Features have implemented so far:
    * eraserTool 
        completed:
            1. ellipse eraser
                //there are still bugs causing weird issues to leave shape outlines when erasing areas
                //I am going to make sure ellipse eraser is fine before adding rectangle eraser as it share almost the same code

            incomplete:
            1. Add a rectangle eraser
            2. add a slider to change size of the eraser


    * editShape 
        completed:
            1. functional editShape

        incomplete:
            1. Adding pop up window when the tool is first selected for
                better user experience. 
   
    * sprayStars
        completed:
            1. basic star trails 
                //its functional but its very basic and i am consider to improve it with more features to add to my incomplete list for next week
   
End of week evaluation: 
During week 3, I manage to add buttons and tool menu and started the spraystars function but I felt i could improve it by adding more functions.
However, by adding buttons the edit shape and eraser tool somehow I created new bugs which completely make the tools unusable again. 

Plan for next week: 
My plan for next week is to make the tool usable again and fix as much bugs as possible and complete erasertool, edishape and spraystar tools.

Week 4 :
Features have implemented so far:

    * eraserTool 
        1. Add a rectangle eraser
        2. add a slider to change size of the eraser

    * editShape 
        1. Adding pop up window when the tool is first selected for better user experience. 
    * sprayStars
        *size,side and spary area configure tools
            
   
End of week evaluation: 
I spend a week fixing bugs and testing and i manage to get the tools working again. I have all so added the rectangel eraser, 
slider to change the size of eraser. It did took me sometime research how to implemented sliders and grabbing the value from the slider to change to size.
I was still having problem with edishape finish button but i manage to overcome this problem without having the button as when switching tools or click the 
editshape tool icon again will automatically finish the button. in reality i didnt acctually fix this bug but I find a way of overcome to avoid the bug and 
achieve the same result. I added a pop up window when the tool is first selected to notify the user how to finish the shape to improves user experience by over
come confusions. I also spend time adding comments to help for easy readability and convert parts codes to functions so when i reuse to create and call other functions. 
It is much easier to debug and understanding what the code is doing. However, I was having problem with changing the sparystar size.

Plan for next week: 
My plan for next week is to add a file import tool to upload image/drawings to the canvas and try fix the sparystar size issue.

Week 5 :(last week)
Features have implemented so far:

    * eraserTool 

    * editShape 

    * sprayStars

    * uploadimage
        Code is implemented in the sketch.js and index.html file 
            
End of week evaluation: 
In week 5, I spend all week trying to figguring out how to add a upload image function to allow the user to upload their drawings or image to the canvas.
It took me hours doing research and watching tutorial on Youtube I manage to successfully add and complete this function. before when i upload the image it drawing will appear 
at the button page of the drawing canvas, now the image will appear in the drawing canvas. However, I am still having problem with the sparystar size configureation, I had to 
remove it.
